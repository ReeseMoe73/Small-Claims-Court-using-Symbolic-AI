This is an educational prototype. It does not deliver legal advice, does not file cases, and jurisdictional rules vary. Treat outputs as non-binding guidance only. 

This asset provides an opinionated “first mile” for small-claims intake:

Triage: Given a binary feature vector (e.g., money not refunded, landlord-tenant, broken contract), a Naive Bayes model predicts a coarse case type (e.g., Security Deposit, Personal Injury, Debt Collection).

Debt rules check: A minimal rule set evaluates whether a simple debt claim is likely in-scope (amount threshold, days since due, payment status, digital signature).
